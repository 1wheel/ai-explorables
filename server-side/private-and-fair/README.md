Colabs that generate data for [Can a Model Be Differentially Private and Fair?](https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/private-and-fair/).


- [MNIST_Generate_UMAP](): Parses privacy rankings and projects MNIST digits with UMAP. 
- [MNIST DP - Model Grid](): Trains a series of differentially private models with different levels of privacy and training data to generate the accuracy tradeoff line charts. 
- [MNIST DP - Rotated](): Trains model with rotated digits for the [Subgroup Size and Accuracy Appendix](https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/private-and-fair/#appendix-subgroup-size-and-accuracy) .
